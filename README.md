enabling ternary hash tree-based integrity verification for secure cloud data storage
In this project, we propose a Cloud data storage that has become increasingly popular in recent years, but it poses several security challenges, including data integrity. Data integrity is crucial in cloud storage, ensuring that data is not tampered with or corrupted during transmission or storage. Traditional integrity verification methods such as message authentication codes (MAC) and hash functions can be used to verify data integrity in cloud storage. Still, they suffer from high computational overhead and large storage requirements.
a novel approach for integrity verification in cloud storage using ternary hash trees. Ternary hash trees provide a more efficient and reliable approach for integrity verification compared to traditional methods. The proposed approach utilizes a tree structure for efficient data retrieval and integrity verification, making it suitable for large-scale cloud storage systems.

In the cloud computing environment, where education, healthcare, and other sectors heavily rely on cloud services for storing and processing business operations, ensuring the integrity of data becomes a critical concern. While cloud services offer vast computing resources and storage space, they also introduce various threats to data integrity, including data loss and outages of significant cloud services.
Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) may encounter Byzantine failure problems, occasionally remove rarely accessed files, or choose not to disclose data loss errors to protect their reputation. Consequently, users who entrust their data to the cloud have limited visibility into the confidentiality and integrity of their outsourced data.
